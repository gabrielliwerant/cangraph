# Cangraph.js

Code library built to provide abstracted methods for drawing and plotting graphs
on the HTML5 canvas.

This is useful if you have a pre-determined graph shape or function upon which
you want to provide visualizations or plot indivual values. This contrasts with
libraries that expect to draw graphs based on datasets, like d3.

## Dependencies

* jQuery (tested with 2.1.0)
* Tested only in Chrome v33

## Roadmap

* Remove jQuery as a dependency to increase portability and lower payload
* Provide additional options for graph visualizations
* Add support for animation
* Show good examples of use cases
* Add support for responsiveness
* Work on cross-browser support
